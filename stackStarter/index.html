    <p>Paragraphs are the most common way to create text on a page. They naturally get their own spacing</p>
    <em>We can also write with emphasis</em>
    <!-- We needs a new line so we use the Br tag  -->
    <br/>
    <b>OR BOLD!</b>

    <p>We sometimes need to list elements</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Here is an unordered list</li>
        <li>We get the bullets by default</li> 
        <li>We can style them though!</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Here is an ordered list</li>
        <li>We get the numbers by default</li> 
        <li>We can style them though!</li>
    </ol>


    <h3>Divs</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Divs are one of the most important things within html</p> 
        <p>They allow us to structure our pages and play with specified elements</p>
    </div>

    <div id="first">
        <p>This div has an id attribute that we called "first"</p> 
        <p>"First" is an arbitrary value we could call anything we wanted</p>
        <p>The ID attribute of "first" allows us to specify this specific div.</p>
        <p>IT is best practice to only use an ID attribute on one element. Just like your name or social security number should only point to you.</p>
        <a href="#">It will apply to everyting between the div tags</a>
    </div> 

        <div class="box">
            <p>This div has a class attribute that we called "box"</p>
            <p>"Box" is an arbitrary value we could call anything we wanted</p>
            <p>The class attribute allows us to specify ANY div that has the class "box".</p>
            <a href="#">It will apply to everyting between the div tags</a>
        </div>
